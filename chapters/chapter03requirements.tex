The child uses the app to check their quests and mark any as complete. 
The parent can then either use the child’s app (with a pin code) or use their own parent edition of the app to approve the completion.

The parent can create a quest with 5 different difficulty levels ranging from very hard to very easy, which the game will automatically generate a reward based on the difficulty. 
This is to minimize the level of interaction required from the parent.
