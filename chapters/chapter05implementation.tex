\chapter{Implementation}

As the project began it was clear that my initial database/class diagrams were drawn with incorrect assumptions about the project. 
Previously, I have mostly worked on systems that handle many users logging into a web application and designed databases as such. 
However, I did not account for the fact that with an android application, the database only needs to handle one user, which allowed me to use a simpler - less relationship heavy - database design.
