I chose to use a pre-built Object Relational Mapping library to interface with the database, rather than crafting particular queries on an ad hoc basis.
This was primarily for more ease-of-use purposes than any performance reasons. 
I considered a variety of options for which library to use, initially deciding upon SugarORM due to its very quick learning curve and low use of boilerplate syntax. 
However, ultimately I decided to go with GreenDAO due to more community support and better documentation.

To safely store and version control the code, I used a GitHub private repository to host my code in cloud storage and allow for me to better manage changes to the codebase.
