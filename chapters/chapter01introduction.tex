\section{Problem Definition}
Parents can often find it difficult to motivate their children to perform chores in a timely manner. 
Many parents have attempted to implement a simple reward system to incentivise their children, but often fail to keep up with the rewards or maintain the tracking needed to make the positive reinforcement truly effective.
I believe this is a problem that all parents face, and one we have all faced as children ourselves.  

\section{Proposed Artefact}
I want to create a proof-of-concept mobile application that will allow parents to assign tasks and rewards to their children in the form of `quests' in a role-playing game, effectively gamifying chores. 
The quests can take the form of ``Tidy your room'' or ``Complete your homework'' and offer rewards of experience points (XP) and gold. The application will also allow the child to create an in-game character that they can customise and level up using aforementioned gold and XP.
I believe the app will provide children with incentive and positive reinforcement to achieve more.

\section{Clients}
The key clients for this app will be the parent(s) or guardians inputting quests into the game and marking a quest as complete once they have inspected the work. 
The child will also be able to view quests, notify the parents that a quest requirement is ready for inspection, and purchase real life rewards from a reward shop.
Parents will also be able to monitor their children's activities and progress, whilst approving or rejecting various activities that the child may encounter whilst using the application. 

I envisage this app to be most suitable for children between the ages of 10 and 17, though it has not been designed exclusively for that age range.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
The aim of this project is to evaluate the usefulness of game-based rewards for children performing chores. 
To achieve this, I have identified the following objectives for the software artefact:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a well designed mobile application, capable of tracking progress and offering rewards for chores and adhering to the Android Developer specifications
	\item Create a secure and robust public API to allow applications to connect to the the artefact's service
	\item Utilise appropriate technologies to securely create the two deliverables to a high quality
	\item Utilise test-driven development to provide automated testing, ensuring test coverage of over 80\% for the API
\end{itemize}

\section{Risks}
In this project, I will be working with a variety of technologies that I have not previously used or am not very experienced with, such as Flask, Android and REST. 
This presents a likely risk that the learning curves of these tools may be steeper than expected.
If this occurs, it is likely that initial time-frame estimates for the development will be inaccurate, as features involving these technologies may incur delays.
The scale and importance of the above delays could, in themselves, lead to the project not entirely fulfilling the above objectives. I believe this makes the above risk high severity.
In order to mitigate this, I have researched a variety of different learning materials that I will be able to access throughout the project to help me better understand these tools.
Furthermore, I have sourced potential help from my placement company, where colleagues have agreed to provide guidance in areas they are experienced in.

As this is a task management app, the artefact risks becoming more of a hindrance then a help.
There is a possibility that the app could become too intrusive to parents giving their children a task, as what would normally be a simple request could be delayed by the additional process of entering and tracking the task.
If this was to occur, it would result in the app being less desirable to use.
However, I believe that if I put a sufficient focus on usability within the app and attempt to design my use cases to have as little resistance as possible, I can avoid this risk.
I can also mitigate this risk by offering Parent users their own version of the app, which would allow them to circumvent any security features designed to stop a Child from giving themselves rewards.
