\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
Parents often find it difficult to motivate children to perform chores in a timely manner.

I want to create a mobile application that will allow parents to assign tasks and rewards to their children in the form of 'quests' in a role-playing game, effectively gamifying chores. 
The quests can take the form of “Tidy your room” or “Complete your homework” and offer rewards of experience points and gold to level up the child's in-game avatar. 
I believe the incentive and the positive reinforcement to 
Quests can have an expiry date and give an optional penalty if not completed in time or to a required standard.

The key interactions in this app will be the parent(s) inputting quests into the game and marking a quest as complete once they have inspected the work. 
The child will also be able to view quests, notify the parents that a quest requirement is ready for inspection and choose skills and equipment for their character.
