As I am the only developer on the project, there are several steps I have taken to minimize risks of the project.
I am undertaking a self code-review policy, where I reserve some time to inspect the code of each feature branch before it is merged into the master branch.
I believe that if I am sufficiently strict with the reviews, they will help me ensure that code quality is kept up to an acceptable standard.
