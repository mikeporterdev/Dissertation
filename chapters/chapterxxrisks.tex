As this is a solo development project, there is a significant risk that there will be flaws in the initial design. 
This is due to the fact - coupled with the fact that this is new technology to me - that there is a high probability that I will misunderstand what is needed for certain designs or misunderstand what the correct tool for the job is.

I would argue that during this project, it is almost certain that the spec for this project will change.

As I am the only developer on the project, there are several steps I have taken to minimize risks of the project.
I am undertaking a self code-review policy, where I reserve some time to inspect the code of each feature branch before it is merged into the master branch.
I believe that if I am sufficiently strict with the reviews, they will help me ensure that code quality is kept up to an acceptable standard.
