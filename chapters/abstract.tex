\chapter*{Abstract}
It can be difficult for parents to motivate children to perform given chores or tasks in a timely manner.
This project aims to create a system for parents to help encourage children in the form of a gamified task management mobile app.
The app will reward children for performing a task using a popular video game based reward structure by offering `Experience Points', which will, when collected, allow them to level up their character.  
This report will detail how I have designed and developed the system surrounding these goals.

Research will be performed into the study of motivation and rewards, particularly with children, and into what will be the best tools I can implement to benefit this.

The artefact has been created as a central server based REST API that receives and handles web service requests to return JSON data.
This API is interfaced via an Android application which will display the received data in an aesthetically pleasing and informative format.

I have approached this project using agile and test driven development methodologies to create a well structured and reliable software artefact.
Requirements were gathered using brainstorming skills and were refined using the MoSCoW method to create a list of features that I believed would motivate children to perform tasks.
